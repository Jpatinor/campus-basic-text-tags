        <h2>Marking up Text in Blocks</h2>
        <p>
            When you have text that is displayed in a block, usually with multiple lines, its considered a paragraph.
            Paragraph text can include words or phrases that are emphasized in some way, and they can contain links and
            other markup used for text (but not headings). Paragraphs are block-level elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may happen that you have text, like a poem, that requires some special formatting. You'd need to ensure that
            each line displayed at a proper length, and you can do that with the line break tags. These will not be used
            outside of that purpose or for formatting an address in an address tag. Don't add line breaks to paragraphs,
            forms, or other page elements. Use CSS for styling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember that you can use tags like <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> to convey meaning
            in text (these are not just to make text <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic</em>; they add meaning).

        <h3>Excerpt from <cite>The Raven</cite> - a Poem by Edgar Allen Poe</h3>
        <p>
            Once upon a a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
            Over many a  quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there come a tapping,<br>
            As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
            "Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this and nothing more."

        <h2>Marking Up Text to Convey Meaning</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes, you are marking up small pieces of text, including single letters and words, to convey some meaning.
            When doing this, you want to use the most appropriate tags you can.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if your page offered search results, its likely that you'd want to <mark>highlight</mark> the terms the user searched for in the results uyou return.
            If the user searched for <mark>"focus area"</mark> and the following paragraph was returned, those words should be highlighted in that paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary <mark>focus area</mark> must be chosen from one of the four GIT focus areas (Front-end Web Design and Development;Print; and Publishing;2D/3D Animation). The secondary focus area can be any topic that will best aid the student's career path.
        </p>
        <p>
            We used the <b>&lt;b&gt;</b> and <i>&lt;i&gt;</i> tags above, but we haven't talked about the <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> tags. These are not oftem used, and can confuse the user as they style text with an
            underline, the smae way that links do by default. A good use for these is to highlight <code>spelling</code> errors
